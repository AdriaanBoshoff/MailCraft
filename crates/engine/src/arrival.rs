//! New mail told of, and Send/Receive on a timer.

//! Each receive notes the unread messages it put in an Inbox; the window tells the owner of

//! `mail.newMailAlerts` says, and opens one with `mail.openArrived`. What a message says of
//! itself (its sender and subject) is a stranger's text, shown and never acted on.
//!
//! `Session::send_receive_due` is asked by the host every so often, and sends and receives
//! every `send_receive_min` minutes (`mail.sendReceiveEvery`), counted from the end of the last
//! Send/Receive, whoever asked for it.
