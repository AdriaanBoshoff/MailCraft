//! New mail told of as it comes: the Inbox of each IMAP account is watched on a connection of
//! its own with IDLE ([RFC 2177]), and when the server says something in it changed, the
//! account is received from at once, as a Send/Receive of that account alone would.
//!
//! A watch runs on a thread of its own and never changes the mailbox: it says what it heard,
//! and `Session::watch_due`, on the session's thread, begins the receive. The Inbox is opened
//! with EXAMINE, so watching it changes nothing on the server, not even which messages are new.
//! A connection that is lost is made again, soon when it had been watching and later each time
//! it could not be made; a server that does not offer IDLE is received from on the timer only.
//! Watching is turned off with `mail.newMailAsItComes`.
