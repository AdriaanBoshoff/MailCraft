//! Receiving: new mail is taken down from each account's incoming server into the Inbox of the
//! account's own data file (`account::account_store`), or, where the host keeps none, of the
//! data file new mail is kept in, on a thread of its own. An IMAP account with a data file of
//! its own has every folder of the server there: Sent, Drafts, Deleted Items, Junk Email and
//! Archive are the ones the server marks so ([RFC 6154]) or names so, and any other is made
//! with the same name and place. An account's own data file is saved once mail has come into
//! it. Nothing is taken down twice: an
//! account remembers what it took (`accounts::Received`), and that is moved on only once the
//! message is in the Inbox.
//!
//! The server is changed as little as can be: IMAP messages are read without marking them read
//! (`BODY.PEEK`), and a POP3 message is taken off the server, when the account says so, only on
//! a later receive, once the data file it went into has been saved; a message is never removed
//! from a server before it is kept here.
