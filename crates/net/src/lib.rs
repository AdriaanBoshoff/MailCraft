//! Mail on the network: IMAP ([RFC 9051], [RFC 3501]), POP3 ([RFC 1939]) and SMTP submission
//! ([RFC 5321], [RFC 6409]) clients.
//!
//! The clients speak over a [`Stream`] a [`Connector`] gives them, so the protocols are the same
//! code whether the bytes go to a server over TLS or to the in-process fake server the tests use
//! (`fake`, behind the feature of that name). Nothing in this crate outside a connector opens a
//! socket.
//!
//! What a server says is hostile: every line, literal, list and count it sends is capped before
//! anything is allocated for it, and a reply that breaks the protocol is an error, never a panic.
//! Passwords are held in a [`Secret`], which never prints and is never put in an error.
