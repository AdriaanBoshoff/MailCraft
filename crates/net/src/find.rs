//! An account's servers found from its address, as Auto Account Setup finds them, in this
//! order:
//!
//! 1. what is known of large providers, kept here (`KNOWN`);

//!    `https://autoconfig.<domain>/mail/config-v1.1.xml` or under
//!    `https://<domain>/.well-known/autoconfig/`, fetched over HTTPS only;
//! 3. the servers the domain names in its DNS SRV records for mail programs ([RFC 6186],
//!    with the implicit-TLS services of [RFC 8314] first);
//! 4. the provider that takes the domain's mail, known by its mail exchangers (MX): a domain
//!    whose mail goes to Google, Microsoft 365, Yahoo, Fastmail, Zoho, iCloud or Yandex is
//!    given that provider's servers, which are kept here, never names read from the answer;
//! 5. the usual names of a domain's mail servers (`imap.`, `mail.`, `smtp.` and the domain
//!    itself), each greeted over TLS, or made secure with STARTTLS, and signed in to by none.
//!
//! The address itself is sent to no one: only its domain is named, in the server names asked
//! for. What a web server sends is hostile: its size is capped, it is read as XML without
//! anything fetched for it, and a name or port in it that is not one is passed over. A server
//! that offers no secure connection is never chosen. DNS answers are not signed and can be
//! changed on the way, so what SRV records name comes with a note to check it; it is only
//! ever filled into the form, for the owner to keep or change, and its certificate is checked
//! as any server's is.
