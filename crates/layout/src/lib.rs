//! Lays a message out on pages, for printing.
//!
//! What comes out is pages of placed glyphs, fills and lines, in points from each page's top
//! left corner ([`Printed`]); writing them to a file or a printer is someone else's work. The
//! body is the formatted document the reading pane draws ([`openmailclient_formats::rich::Doc`]),
//! with the same rules for paragraphs, borders and tables, so a message prints as it reads.
//!
//! Fonts are the installed ones, found by name ([`openmailclient_fonts`]); a face that may not be
//! put into a document is passed over for the next name. Text is set one character to one
//! glyph, left to right, with the pairs a face kerns standing as close as it says: there is
//! no shaping and no right-to-left setting yet.
//! Pictures stand in the line of text at the size the body asks for, or at one side with the
//! text beside them where the body asks for that; the caller says how large each is and draws
//! it.
//!
//! Everything in a body is hostile: sizes, widths, spans and nesting are capped, and so are the
//! pages and the glyphs one message may take.
