//! Draws a message body that was read into a formatted document.
//!
//! A link shows where it points when the pointer rests on it and is never followed. A picture is
//! drawn only when the message carries it, as an attachment or written into the body, and it
//! could be decoded ([`Pictures`]); any other picture is an empty frame of the size it asks for,
//! or a labelled placeholder when it asks for none. A picture stands in the line of text it is
//! written in, or at one side when it asks to, with what follows beside it until it ends. An
//! attachment that stands in the text is a small card there with our own mark, its name and its
//! size; a click on it asks where to save it, and nothing is opened or run. A
//! border a style asks for is drawn round its paragraphs, its table or its cell. Text is drawn in the font it
//! names when that font, or an open one of the same measures, is installed ([`Faces`]). Colours
//! a message asks for are kept only where they stay readable on what is behind them. Sizes follow what Outlook Classic
//! was seen to do with the same message (`docs/ui-parity.md`, "Message bodies").
