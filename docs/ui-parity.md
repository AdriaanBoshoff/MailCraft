# UI parity

**Status:** revision 21 · 2026-10-13 · borders round text within a line and rounded corners on boxes and cells (M3b.26), ours, not compared with Outlook; boxes inside one another, tables inside blocks and a colour behind the whole body in the reading pane (M3b.25), ours, not compared with Outlook; several pictures at the sides of a paragraph and paper behind dark see-through pictures in the dark pane (M3b.24), ours, not compared with Outlook; the print window has a zoom and Table Style's columns, headings and rows (M3b.22); side-by-side looks at the Mail module in both ribbon layouts, and at eight message bodies; layout only.

How OpenMailClient's window compares with Outlook Classic's, from window captures of both at the same size.
Outlook captures hold private mail, stay on the dev machine and are never committed; this page records
only layout and measurements. Numbers are logical pixels at 96 dpi, from a 1440 × 753 window.

## What was compared

Outlook Classic 16.0, Mail module, as configured on the dev machine: **simplified (single-line) ribbon**
and a **dark grey theme**. Both are user settings; the classic ribbon and the light themes are equally
Outlook Classic. The classic ribbon was captured once by switching the layout for one capture and
switching it back; the theme was left alone, so the light themes are still unobserved. OpenMailClient has
both ribbon layouts (`ui.ribbonMode`) and a light and a dark colour set (`ui.theme`); it starts with the
simplified ribbon in the light set. The colours are our own in both sets, not Outlook's.

The two ribbon layouts share one window shell: title bar, module strip, tab row and panes are the same,
and only the ribbon panel's height and contents change. OpenMailClient follows that.

## Measurements

## Message bodies

Two messages from OpenMailClient's own sample mailbox and six probe messages (all synthetic, written by
us) were saved as `.msg` and opened in an Outlook Classic message window, one at a time, then closed
without saving. The window was compared with OpenMailClient's reading pane showing the same message.
Nothing from the owner's mailbox was involved.

Not followed yet, in order of how much they show: the space Outlook
leaves between a paragraph and a table; a left border standing out in the margin; lines shared by
neighbouring cells (`border-collapse`). They are in [gaps.md](gaps.md), item 3.

## Printing

Not compared against Outlook's print output yet: printing from Outlook would use a real printer
or its print dialog, and neither is driven on the shared machine. OpenMailClient's Memo Style page (the
owner's name over a line, field names in bold beside their values, the body, a page number at the
foot) is laid out from general knowledge of the style, and its measures are our own. File > Print
and Ctrl+P open a print window: the page as it will be printed beside the paper, direction, margins,
header and footer; its button asks for a PDF file to write. It prints the open message (Memo Style) or the
folder's list (Table Style, with columns that are chosen, group headings and the selected row alone; the page is shown whole or at 25 to 400 hundredths of its size). The window's arrangement is our own;
Outlook's print pane was not observed.

## Behaviour seen

- Opening a folder selects the first row but **does not open it** in the reading pane; the pane shows the
  empty state until the user picks a message. OpenMailClient selects nothing when a folder opens. To check
  further before changing: this may depend on Outlook's reading-pane options.

## Next

1. Favorites (the panes are sized by dragging since M3b.3).
2. An overflow menu for the simplified ribbon, and the "tell me" command search.
3. A light theme has not been observed (the theme setting roams to the owner's other machines, so
   it was not switched; ask first).
