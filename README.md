A clean-room, open-source mail client written in Rust, aiming at parity with Microsoft Outlook Classic
(the Win32 desktop Outlook): the same layout and behaviour, files that go both ways, and every feature
reachable as a command from the UI, a CLI and (later) an MCP server.

OpenMailClient is an independent concept project. It is not affiliated with Microsoft. It follows the
conventions of [`storytold/wordcraft`](https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft).

*The sample mailbox (invented content), drawn by `ui_shot`. The receipt is stored only as RTF.*

## Progress

The numbers are measured, not estimated: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) has the headline numbers and the
progress log, [docs/parity-checklist.md](docs/parity-checklist.md) is generated from the feature
catalog, and [docs/gaps.md](docs/gaps.md) ranks what is missing.

### Milestones

| | Milestone | State |
|---|---|---|

Closed milestones still have work left over: it is not dropped. Each piece is a row in
[Do later](ROADMAP.md#do-later-from-m2) with the slot it lands in, and is struck when it lands.
67 rows are done; 29 are open: 17 in M5, 1 in M6, 1 in M7 (after the first release), 1 with M1's checks against
Outlook, and 9 that wait on something we do not have yet (an Outlook-written file of a kind we may
read, a reader we can try without driving a window, a printer we may use).

### Outlook Classic features with a command

| Area | Done | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mail | 36 of 68 | `██████████░░░░░░░░░░` | 52% |
| File | 10 of 15 | `█████████████░░░░░░░` | 66% |
| Message window | 6 of 18 | `██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` | 33% |
| Calendar | 4 of 9 | `█████████░░░░░░░░░░░` | 44% |
| People | 0 of 5 | `░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` | 0% |
| Tasks | 0 of 5 | `░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` | 0% |
| **All** | **56 of 120** | `█████████░░░░░░░░░░░` | **46%** |

### File formats and protocols

| | Read | Written |
|---|---|---|
| `.pst`, `.ost` (ANSI, Unicode, 4K pages) | yes | a whole mailbox as a new Unicode, ANSI or 4K-page `.pst`; changes to an open `.pst` of any of the three are kept by Save Changes, and the file stays the kind it was (Outlook Classic opens them and sees what was written) |
| `.msg`, `.oft` | yes | yes |
| `.eml` | yes | yes |
| `.pdf` | | yes, a message (Memo Style) or a folder's list (Table Style), printed |
| IMAP, POP3, SMTP | accounts are set up and tested in Account Settings, mail is sent and received into each account's own data file, checked against a real server; every IMAP folder is taken down, what is sent is put in the server's Sent folder, read, flagged, moved and deleted messages go both ways, folders renamed, moved and deleted are followed both ways, and drafts are kept on the server as they are written (M4) | the same |

## What works today

- Opens Outlook data files (`.pst`, `.ost`) and single messages (`.msg`, `.oft`, `.eml`). Nothing is
  written to a data file until Save Changes (Ctrl+S): changes to a Unicode or ANSI `.pst` are then written
  into the file where it is, so a flag on one message is a few pages and not the mailbox again. What a save
  writes over is kept beside the file until the save is checked and read back, and is put back if anything
  goes wrong, a power cut included; the first save keeps the file as it was beside it and writes a whole
  new file that is checked, read back and swapped in. Until then each change is journalled beside the file (or in a folder of our own when that
  one cannot be written), so a crash or a
  closed window does not lose it: it comes back, still unsaved, when the file is opened again.
  `.ost` files are read-only. Once a file has been saved, later changes are saved on their own
  after five minutes at a quiet moment (`file.autoSave`). A save or an export runs beside the window, with
  progress and a way to stop it, and a structure check (`inspect --check`) reads a data file
  through without changing it.
- An Outlook-Classic-style window: ribbon (simplified and classic), folder pane, message list with
  date groups, reading pane; dialogs in the theme's colours; nine built-in themes and themes of
  your own, each with its own light and dark colours, any of 25 colours changed with a live
  preview and a contrast check, or following the system's light or dark setting.
- Read, flag, categorise, move, delete, archive, search, sort and filter in writable (in-memory) stores.
- Reply, reply all, forward and new mail as drafts; saving messages as `.msg`, `.oft` or `.eml`.
- **Formatted bodies.** HTML and RTF mail is laid out and drawn: fonts the message names (installed
  ones only), colours, lists, links, tables (cell borders, fills, merged cells, tables inside cells),
  paragraph borders and spacing, bordered and filled blocks inside one another, rounded corners, borders round
  text within a line, a colour behind the whole body, line spacing, tab stops, right-to-left text. Nothing in a message is run and
  nothing is fetched.
- **Pictures.** Attached and written-in pictures (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, SVG, bitmaps, Windows and enhanced metafiles
  that are drawings, with the bitmaps, hatched and patterned brushes and clipped regions in them) are decoded in-process and drawn in the text; animated GIF, PNG and WebP
  pictures are played, or stand still when asked (`view.animations`); pictures stand at the sides of
  a paragraph with the text beside them; an attachment that stands in the
  text is a card that a click asks about: open it or save it.
- **Printing.** A message (Memo Style) or a folder's list (Table Style) prints to a PDF file, with
  tables, borders and pictures; a print window shows the pages beside the page setup (paper,
  direction, margins, header and footer) and has a zoom; Table Style prints the columns chosen,
  group headings and the selected row. Nothing is sent to a printer yet.
- **Import from Outlook.** Every IMAP and POP3 account of the Outlook profiles, with its servers and
  without its password, and the profiles' data files: shown first, then copied without changing
  Outlook's own files, an `.ost` made a `.pst` of our own.
- A sample mailbox with invented content, for trying things without any real mail.

## What does not work yet

- **Proof against Outlook.** `.pst` files written here open in Outlook Classic with every folder
  and message as written, whole, ANSI and saved into in place; a file written before M3c.1 is written
  whole on its next save, keeping its ids, and then opens too; an `.ost` is exported with its
  hidden items as a `.pst` Outlook opens. No Outlook-written `.pst` has been saved into yet. A 4K-page file is
  written whole on every save (M3c.2), its larger blocks deflated as Outlook stores them (M3c.7).
- **Parts of formatted bodies.** Right-to-left text while it is typed; complex scripts
  on screen beyond what egui shapes; metafiles that copy with a mask or see-through; printing to a
  printer. Each is scheduled in
  [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md#do-later-from-m2).
- Recurring appointments, `.ics`, CalDAV sync and meetings in the Calendar; People and Tasks.
- The MCP server, the control channel and the web build.

## Run it

```bash
cargo run --release -p openmailclient -- --sample
```

```bash
cargo run --release -p openmailclient -- path/to/archive.pst
```

The page setup, the panes and their sizes, the window's size and place, the theme and the data files that were open are kept between runs in
`settings.json` in the per-user configuration folder (`%APPDATA%\OpenMailClient` on Windows) and
the data files are opened again when a run names none. To start without it:

```bash
cargo run --release -p openmailclient -- --no-settings
```

Without a window:

```bash
cargo run --release -p openmailclient-cli -- inspect path/to/archive.pst --check
```

```bash
cargo run --release -p openmailclient-cli -- convert message.msg message.eml
cargo run --release -p openmailclient-cli -- convert mailbox.ost copy.pst
```

A screenshot of the real UI without opening a window:

```bash
cargo run --release -p openmailclient-ui-egui --example ui_shot
```

## Safety rules the code follows

- **Never crash, never lose mail.** No panics in non-test code; every reader has a hostile-input test;
  a data file is not written to until a save is asked for; a save writes a temporary file, checks it and swaps it in, or writes into the file with an undo file beside it that puts it back byte for byte if the save does not end.
- **Mail is hostile and private.** Message content is data: nothing in a message is run, and remote
  content is never fetched by itself: pictures are downloaded only when you ask, over HTTPS, and never from your own network. An attachment is opened only when you say so on a double-click, as a read-only copy marked as from the internet; a program or a script is only ever saved to a file you choose.
- **Clean room.** Formats come from public specifications ([MS-PST], [MS-OXMSG], RFC 5322, …). No
  Microsoft code, icons, fonts or wording; icons are drawn in code.

## Development

```bash
cargo xtask ci
```

runs formatting, clippy with warnings denied, the tests, and the asset, layering, parity and wasm checks.
